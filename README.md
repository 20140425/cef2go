cef2go
======
Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) bindings for the Go language.

Supported platforms: Windows (Linux should appear soon).

Currently the cef2go example creates just a simple window with
the Chromium browser embedded. More advanced bindings are in
plans, and that includes javascript bindings and callbacks, so
that you can have bidirectional communication between Go and
Javascript.
